As more and more of the technology we have around us collect our data, there begins to be a constant overwhelming feeling of being watched and judged.  This feeling created in a similar manner as with Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon can begin to affect how we act in our day to day lives.  This project is an attempt to show people how just the idea of being watched can affect their actions.  By telling them that they are being watched they will hopefully take much longer than necessary to break free.  Through this project I hope to help others begin to critically think about what is watching them and how that affects them.
